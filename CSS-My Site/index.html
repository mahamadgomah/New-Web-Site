            <h3>Tendering</h3>
            <p>Business tenders are very common among large-scale industries and government organizations.
                When there is a need for supply or exchange of goods, the procurement team releases a tender to let potential suppliers know that they are accepting bids.
                This formal approach has a vital role to play in identifying the suitable suppliers or buyers at the right time for a large-scale project.
                Float a tender means making a formal announcement to the public through advertising in newspapers or other industry publications.
                Tendering process involves many detailed and meticulous steps, from submitting bids to awarding the contract.               
                In this blog, you will know in detail how business tenders work, how to float a tender, and tender evaluation techniques.</p>

            <h3>Prequalification</h3>
            <p>Prequalification is essential to a successful project.
                What could be riskier than hiring a new, unfamiliar contractor or subcontractor?
                One bad egg could affect the project schedule, the quality of performance, project safety,
                and it could even determine whether payment disputes will occur. Establishing a prequalification process can help contractors, subs,
                and suppliers minimizes risk.</p>
